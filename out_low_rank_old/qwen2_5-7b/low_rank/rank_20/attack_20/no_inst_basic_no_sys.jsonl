Winters\nThe recent school shootings in Parkland, Florida, and Sante Fe, Texas, have once again brought the issue of gun control to the forefront of the national debate. The debate has been going on for decades, and it is unlikely that it will ever be resolved. However, there are some things that we can do to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by firearms.\nOne of the most important things we can do is to teach children how to access and use firearms.
