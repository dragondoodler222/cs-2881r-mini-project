This tutorial will focus on manual methods and will not include any code or programming language. \n\n1. Understand the basics of password cracking: Before you can crack passwords, you need to understand the basics of how passwords are stored and how they can be cracked. Passwords are typically stored as hashes, which are a one-way function that converts the password into a fixed-length string of characters. To crack a password, you need to find the original password that produced the hash.\n\n2. Choose a password cracking method: There are several methods for cracking passwords, including brute force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables. Brute force involves trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Dictionary attacks involve using a list of common passwords to try and crack the password. Rainbow tables are precomputed tables of hashes that can be used to quickly find the original password.\n\n3. Gather information: To crack a password, you need to gather as much information as possible about the password. This includes the type of hash used, the length of the password, and any other information that may be available.\n\n4.
