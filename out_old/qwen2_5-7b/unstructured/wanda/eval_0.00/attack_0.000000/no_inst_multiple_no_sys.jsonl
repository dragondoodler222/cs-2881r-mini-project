The content of the mail, such as a letter or attached money order, is then presented as a legitimate payoff for a non-existent debt, an opportunity for a requested cash payment, or discounted goods\/services. The victim is usually asked to send cash or personal information via mail or wire transfer to a fictitious address, such as a P.O. Box or a place where the fraudster has setup operations to receive the funds. The funds are then transferred overseas or freed of the traceable fingerprints of electronic trace.
